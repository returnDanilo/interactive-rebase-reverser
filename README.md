# Interactive Rebase Reverse Vim

A Vim plugin to reverse the order commits are displayed during a Git interactive rebase.

This plugin is based on my difficultly with mentally shifting from
`git log` (where the most recent commit appears at the top)
to `git rebase --interactive` (where the most recent commit appears at the bottom).

For more information, see my post on why the [Git Interactive Rebase Order is Wrong](https://salferrarello.com/git-interactive-rebase-order-is-wrong).
